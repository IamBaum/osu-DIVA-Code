# osu-DIVA-Code
Hi there, this is the Source Code for the 3rd Party Game Mode osu!DIVA.
I know the documentation is bad and the programming is ugly, but i hope this may still help some1 else, to get an idea to create their own 3rd Party Gamemodes for osu!.
The Program has been written in C++, on Microsoft Visual Studio.
